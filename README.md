# Polkadot Blockchain Academy

The Polkadot Blockchain Academy is an intensive academic program teaching Blockchain, Substrate and Polkadot to talented developers.

This program aims at:

* Improving our core dev hiring pipeline in both quantity and quality of candidates
* Seeding the industry with Substrate knowledge and advocates
* Building a surplus of devs for lesser product prototyping if theyâ€™re not hired out
* Improving our non-dev onboarding processes

Selected through an admission process, candidates will receive an intensive education taught by a mix of professionals from Parity, Web3 and some visiting professors.

## Rollout Plan

We are launching the first wave this Summer in the UK with a target of 50 students before growing to three in-person waves of 100 students each in rotating geographies.
