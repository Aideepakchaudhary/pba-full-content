Lecture 5, Module 4

Instructor: Bernhard Schuster, Robert Klotzner

<hr>

### Lecture Goals

- General blockchain challenges
- Parachain consensus
- Valid/invalid parachain blocks
---

## Blockchain Challenges

- Slow
- Don't scale
- Smart Contract based

---

## Goals of Parachains

- Scalability
- Secure
- Liveness
- Performance

Note:

Performance via Specialization: Parachains operate independently via "collator" nodes, can do
whatever they want, as long as the provide a PoV to relay chain validators.

Relay chain validators don't have to bother about handling transaction pools and
such.

---

## How to achieve scalability?

- Split the work
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- But maintain security
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Lifeness?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

Security: Defer solution to upcoming slides.
Lifeness: Suggest rotation.

TODO: Picture of grouped validators validating parachains and collator nodes
connecting, keeping storage for the parachain, handling transaction pools +
transaction gossip. Hint rotating groups via arrows.

Note:

Idea: Visualize how performance and scalability is achieved. For example that
collators are responsible to keep state for the parachains, take care of lots of
the nitty-gritty details of block production. Validators don't have to worry
about individual transactions, collecting & prioritizing them, keeping them in
pools.

In Eth 2 version 1 nomenclature: Collators/Parachain provide shards for data availability,
but also version 2 execution shards.

## All good?

- Bad group?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Large groups?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Performance
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Lifeness
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

Large group: Make it statistically unlikely enough to have a majority malicious
group.

-> relying on statistics: groups have to be relatively large.
-> Lifeness, if nodes don't vote we have to assume the worst -> escalate.

## Catch Bad guys
