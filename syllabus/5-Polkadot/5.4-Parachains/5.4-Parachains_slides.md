# Parachains

---

## Lecture Goals

- General blockchain challenges <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Parachain consensus <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Valid/invalid parachain blocks (PoVs) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Blockchain Challenges

- Performance
- Scalability
- Security
- Liveness
- Decentralization

<!-- TODO DESIGN: Picture of nodes to the right of the list, all doing the same (no grouping) Graphic 1 -->

Notes:

Scalability: In every aspect: Throughput, but also storage.
Relay chain validators are "light clients" to parachains.
Parachains act as heterogenous shards, both in terms of execution and data availability.
In contrast to Ethereum 2, which will just offer sharded data availability.

Performance via Specialization: Parachains operate independently via "collator" nodes, can do whatever they want, as long as the provide a PoV to relay chain validators.
Relay chain validators don't have to bother about handling transaction pools and such.

Parachains help with all of these, but let's focus on scalability first.

---

## How to achieve scalability?

- Split the work <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- But maintain (economic) security! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Liveness? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

Security: Defer solution to upcoming slides. (Also mention shared security.)
Liveness: Suggest rotation.

---

## Split the Work

<!-- TODO DESIGN: Picture of grouped validators validating parachains. Graphic 2 -->

Notes:

Introduce split up work between validators.

---

## Rotate Groups

<!-- TODO DESIGN: Same picture as above, but with arrows hinting roup rotation. Graphic 3 -->

Notes:

Problem: Imagine each group is its own shard/blockchain - that would mean each node, as we rotate, would need to keep state for all those shards/parachains → Does not scale too well.

---

## Introducing Collators

<!--
TODO: Same picture as above, but with collator nodes connecting to the validator groups, keeping storage for the parachain, handling transaction pools + transaction gossip.
Hint rotating groups via arrows. Graphic 4
-->

Notes:

From the perspective of the relay chain collators are completely untrusted and even unknown, but can keep storage and take care of some of the heavy lifting, like gossiping transactions, maintaining transaction pools, ...

Idea: Visualize how performance and scalability is achieved.
For example that collators are responsible to keep state for the parachains, take care of lots of the nitty-gritty details of block production.
Validators don't have to worry about individual transactions, collecting & prioritizing them, keeping them in pools.

In ETH 2 version 1 nomenclature: Collators/Parachain provide shards for data availability, but also version 2 execution shards.

## How does this work - Recap PoV

- Collators - untrusted <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- PoV ... Proof of Validity <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## All good?

- Bad group? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Large groups? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Performance <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Liveness <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

Large group: Make it statistically unlikely enough to have a majority malicious group.
Works, but:

→ Performance: relying on statistics: groups have to be relatively large ~40 validators.
→ Liveness: If nodes don't vote we have to assume the worst → escalate.

# Catch Bad Guys

---

## Wait .. Bad Guys?

What can malicious nodes actually do?

- No (faithfully) PVF execution <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Manipulate messages <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

Quick recap: What harm can a malicious validator actually do? What do we need to worry about?

Not (properly) executing the block, providing results that don't adhere to the rules of the PVF.
Such a block would likely be not accepted by other parachain nodes, but light clients might get fooled and more importantly other parachains can get fooled with manipulated messages.

---

## Catch Bad Guys

- and punish them <!-- when caught --> <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- gamblers ruin <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

- Eventually the system can be broken, but if attempts result in loss of significant funds any realistic attacker will go bankrupt way before.
- Purpose of backing checkers: Get skin in the game - collators are external.

---

## How do we do that?

- 2 (3) phase process <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Validators get skin in the game (backing) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Check the checkers (approvals) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Punish (disputes) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

How: Validators need to be known in advance so collator nodes can connect.
We need to be able to check the checkers.

---

## TODO: Two phase diagram (backing → approvals)

Does this work already? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

No <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

What is the problem? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

1. Approval checkers must not be guessable in advance - solvable via VRF.
2. Data must be guaranteed available, so backers cannot get away with not providing necessary data to approval checkers.

→ Not sufficient.

---

## TODO: Three phase diagram (backing → inclusion/availability → approvals)

Approvals only after we have proof on chain that data is available.

Does this work already?

Yes <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## How to achieve availability?

- Backing group is untrusted
- Collators are untrusted <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Availability proof on chain? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## 1. Solution Attempt

<!-- TODO DESIGN:
Picture where backing group sends data to all validators and they have a green checkmark (they signed something).
Maybe two pictures, one without checkmarks and one with, changing with the bullet points below.
Graphic 6/7
-->

- Send PoV to all validators <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Signed Statement <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Works, but very costly. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## 2. Solution Attempt

<!--
TODO DESIGN: Picture where backing group sends POV only to a _random_ subset of remaining validators - other than that, same above. Graphic 8
-->

---

## 2. Solution Attempt

<!--
TODO DESIGN: Zoom in on nodes which received the PoV, with subset of validators under attack (DoS) and some malicious nodes and one/two which manages to get data out.
Graphic 9
-->

Problems:

- Still inefficient! 40x overhead. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Relatively easy to DoS <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## 3. Solution Attempt

<!--
TODO DESIGN: Illustrating picture?
Graphic 10
-->

- Erasure coding <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Distribute to all <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Overhead only 3x <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Hard to DoS <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Recap

- Known backing group - get skin in the game <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Make available <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Reveal approval checkers <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Catch bad guys <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- ... What now? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

Relay chain validators act as light clients for all parachains and are responsible for making sure all state transactions are sound.
Therefore shards (parachains) don't have to run light clients for all other shards (parachains), but instead only for the relay chain.
