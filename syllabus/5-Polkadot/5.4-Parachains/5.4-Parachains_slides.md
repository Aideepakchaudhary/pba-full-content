- Valid/invalid parachain blocks (PoVs)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Blockchain Challenges

- Performance
- Scalability
- Security
- Liveness
- Decentralization

TODO: Picture of nodes to the right all doing the same (no grouping)

Note:

Scalability: In every aspect: Throughput, but also storage. Relay chain
validators are "light clients" to parachains. Parachains act as heterogenous
shards, both in terms of execution and data availablity. In contrast to Ethereum
2, which will just offer sharded data availability.

Performance via Specialization: Parachains operate independently via "collator" nodes, can do
whatever they want, as long as the provide a PoV to relay chain validators.
Relay chain validators don't have to bother about handling transaction pools and
such.

Parachains help with all of these, but let's focus on scalability first.

---

## How to achieve scalability?

- Split the work
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- But maintain security
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Liveness?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

Security: Defer solution to upcoming slides. (Also mention shared security.)
Liveness: Suggest rotation.

---

## Suggested Architecture

TODO: Picture of grouped validators validating parachains and collator nodes
connecting, keeping storage for the parachain, handling transaction pools +
transaction gossip. Hint rotating groups via arrows.

Note:

Use this picture to explain the basic concepts. Especially the notion of
collators as this is rather unique to the Polkadot architecture. From the
perspective of the relay chain collators are completely untrusted and even
unknown.

Idea: Visualize how performance and scalability is achieved. For example that
collators are responsible to keep state for the parachains, take care of lots of
the nitty-gritty details of block production. Validators don't have to worry
about individual transactions, collecting & prioritizing them, keeping them in
pools.

In Eth 2 version 1 nomenclature: Collators/Parachain provide shards for data availability,
but also version 2 execution shards.

## Recap PoV

- Collators - untrusted
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- PoV ... Proof of Validity
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

TODO: Schematic visualization of a PoV: Merkle Tree with accessed state elements and block data.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## All good?

- Bad group?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Large groups?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Performance
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Liveness
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

Large group: Make it statistically unlikely enough to have a majority malicious
group. Works, but:

-> Performance: relying on statistics: groups have to be relatively large ~40 validators.
-> Liveness: If nodes don't vote we have to assume the worst -> escalate.

## Catch Bad Guys

---

## Wait .. Bad Guys?

What can malicious nodes actually do?

- No (faithfully) PVF execution
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Manipulate messages
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

Quick recap: What harm can a malicious validator actually do? What do we need to
worry about?

Not (properly) executing the block, providing results that don't adhere to the
rules of the PVF. Such a block would likely be not accepted by other parachain
nodes, but light clients might get fooled and more importantly other parachains
can get fooled with manipulated messages.

---

## Catch Bad Guys

- and punish them <!-- when caught -->
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- gamblers ruin
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

- Eventually the system can be broken, but if attempts result in loss of
  significant funds any realistic attacker will go go bankrupt way before.
- Purpose of backing checkers: Get skin in the game - collators are external.

---

## Idea

- 2 (3) phase process
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Validators get skin in the game (backing)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Check the checkers (approvals)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Punish (disputes)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

How: Validators need to be known in advance so collator nodes can connect. We
need to be able to check the checkers.

---

## TODO: Two phase diagram (backing -> approvals)

Does this work already?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

No
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

1. Approval checkers must not be guessable in advance - solvable via VRF.
2. Data must be guaranteed available, so backers cannot get away with not
   providing necessary data to approval checkers.

-> Not sufficient.

---

## TODO: Three phase diagram (backing -> inclusion/availability -> approvals)

approvals only after we have proof on chain that data is available.

Does this work already?

Yes
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## How to achieve availability?

- Backing group is untrusted
- Collators are untrusted
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Availability proof on chain?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## 1. Solution Attempt

TODO: Picture where backing group sends data to all validators.

- Send PoV to all validators
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Signed Statement
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Works, but very costly.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## 2. Solution Attempt

TODO: Picture where backing group sends POV only to a _random_ subset of
remaining validators.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## 2. Solution Attempt

TODO: Zoom in on nodes which received the PoV, with subset of validators under attack (DoS) and some malicious
nodes and one/two which manages to get data out.

Problems:

- Still inefficent! 40x overhead.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Relatively easy to DoS
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## 3. Solution Attempt

TODO: Illustrating picture?
- Erasure coding
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Distribute to all
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Overhead only 3x
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Hard to DoS
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Recap

- Known backing group - get skin in the game
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Make available
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Reveal approval checkers
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Catch bad guys
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- ... What now?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Disputes

## Economic Security

Note:

Relay chain validators act as light clients for all parachains and are
responsible for making sure all state transactions are sound. Therefore shards
(parachains) don't have to run light clients for all other shards (parachains),
but instead only for the relay chain.
